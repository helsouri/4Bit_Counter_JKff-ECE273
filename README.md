# 4Bit_Counter_JKff-ECE273
## Summary
The purpose of this lab is to design a 4-bit counter using JK flip flops <br> <br>
**Files available are:**<br>
  1) Pdf report that conatins all of the below along with detailed procedure <br>
  2) PlanAhead Generated Physical constraints <br>
  3) Test bench code to test a few sample example <br>
  4) Main binary file(.bit) that is then flashed onto board for Demo <br>
  5) Pictures of the main schematic and waveforms <br> <br>
  _Note that all labs are required to have an example test bench and waveforms to display theoretical sucess along with a demo to demonstrate actaul success_
